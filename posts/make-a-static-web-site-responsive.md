I got an email from my dad with the subject line "Make a static web site responsive?" Where he asked:

> Is it possible to make a static website better looking for tiny devices like cell phones?
>
> Something like:
> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>
> Please take a look at [www.scrcptg.org](http://www.scrcptg.org/) and let me know how this could be easily improved for phone viewers.

I took a look and an archive of the site from a different year is here: https://scrcptg.org/2023seminar/ since the current site is updated.
