I've always been interested in logo design and what goes into it. I've had the benefit of working with professional graphic designers at Fireside21 and seeing the process in action. Many times we'll start with an abstract statement of goals for the logo and inspiration. Then we'll do a call that goes over the specifics - for example, this committee covers these 3 main issue areas and so we need to incorporate something from all of those. The designers will then come up with multiple different concepts depending on that conversation. They might be literal - icons for specific topics, or they might be more abstract with shapes that evoke an idea without explicitly using that iconography. Then we have to work with the relevant stakeholders and get their sign off.

Mostly this has worked well as a process, but sometimes at the last minute a new stakeholder will come in and blow up the process since their vision is completely different than the folks we have worked with. Typically age also is a factor - the more senior stakeholders may have delegated the task, then changed their mind at the last minute and they want a more staid design. Thank goodness for hourly billing contracts amirite?

Fortunately/Unfortunately when designing a logo for myself, I don't have to mess with different stakeholders, I get to be the designer and the decision maker. For myself, I looked to different inspiration. I have a really eclectic group of interests and topic that I want to display on this site, but I also have an uncommon name for an American. As such, I decided to use my name as a base to work off of.

I really like symmetry and on tiktok (Where I get inspired by really creative content) I ran across [Cami Creative](https://www.tiktok.com/@cami.creative) who turns different words and names into shapes. I really enjoyed her videos, and decided that I could adapt her style to making an animated logo with SVG and CSS. Elise



At Fireside21 I have worked on logo projects with a designer and what goes into creating them is fascinating.
