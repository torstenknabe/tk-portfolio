Hey 👋! I'm Torsten and I strive to be a full person - to me that means I want to experience everything life has to offer and to learn as much as I can. That means I end up with a lot of interests: I'm a web developer (focusing on accessibility), classically trained musician (bassoon and piano but my true love is theory), recovering politico 🔵, and all around lover of life. I'm a queer person 🏳️‍🌈, a synethete (color/absolute pitch), a DC resident 🚲🚇🚶, and an uncle to 6 (This site is inspired by children's clothing with vibrant colors and strong shapes). Feel free to explore here where I write about my various interests.
